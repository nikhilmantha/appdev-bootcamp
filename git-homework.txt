What’s the difference between ‘git add <file>’, ‘git add .’, and ‘git add -A?

What does git push do? What does git pull do?
- git push publishes the local changes to the remote repository, git pull updates the local repository to match the remote one.

- git fetch downloads the updates to your local repo but does not actually change the files. this lets you look at changes before implementing them locally. git pull combines fetch and merge and makes changes locally.
